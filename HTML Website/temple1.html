                        Adiyogi Shiva Statue, Coimbatore Overview
Surrounded by verdant green farms at the foothills of Velliangiri Mountains in the Western Ghats, Adiyogi Shiva Statue is the world’s biggest bust statue dedicated to the famous Hindu deity Shiva, which is carved out of 500 tonnes of steel. Located in the Isha Yoga Complex in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, the sculpture stands tall at the height of 112 feet.

The Guinness World Book of Records recognised the statue as the “largest bust sculpture” which is 34.3-metre tall excluding plinth, 45 meters long and 7.62 meters wide. Designed by the founder of Isha Foundation- Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, the statue was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the 24th of February, 2017. The sculpture was constructed with the idea to inspire and promote yoga, and 
the statue is called “Adiyoga” meaning “the first yogi” as Lord Shiva is known to be the originator of yoga.
