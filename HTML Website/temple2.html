                    <h3>About the Place</h3>
                  <p>The Marudhamalai hill temple is located at a towering height of 500 ft in the highland on the Western Ghats. 15 kms away to north-west of Coimbatore city, the temple has an excellent invigorating atmosphere. Vehicles are allowed to pass through the Marudhamalai temple and the devasthanam has granted three buses from the low slope of the hill to get through the temple on top.

                    The Marudhamalai temple has its main deity as Lord Muruga and the temple attributes quite delightful facilities to the habit of making their visit a comforting one while offering their prayer to the deity. The major feature of this hill is that it grows important medicinal herbs, which is used extensively in making ayurvedic medicines.
