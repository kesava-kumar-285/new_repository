                    <h3>About the Place</h3>

                  <p>Siruvani Waterfalls is an exhilarating waterfall located in the scenic region of Siruvani. Also known as Kovai Kutralam Falls, it is about 37 kilometres away from Coimbatore city and the waterfall is predominantly manifested for its exaltedness.

                    The water fall is set in the deepest fragment of the impenetrable woodland and due to this reason vacationers are not conceded to visit the falls after 5 pm. The key inception of drinking water in Coimbatore is supplied by Siruvani. Tourists cannot make their visit to this falls anytime because only few numbers of buses are available to visit the place. With a sterling panoramic view, 
                    the dam is a place that will leave you not just enchanted but also fill you with inner joy.  </p>
