                    <h3>About the Place</h3>

                  <p>At a distance of 75 Kms from Coimbatore and 70 Kms from Erode, Kodiveri Dam & Waterfalls is a wonderful picnic spot situated near Satyamangalam in Erode district (20 Kms from Bannari Mariamman Temple).

                    Constructed on Bhavani River, 
                    the Dam provides irrigation water for over 25000 hectars of land. There is a beautiful Park developed at bottom of the dam with many attractions.
                    
                    The Waterfalls formed by the downstream of Kodiveri Dam is a wonderful spot with nice views of the falls (close to the dam). Since the falls are not heavy, anyone can easily reach bottom of the falls and enjoy. Bathing & swimmings in the pool at bottom of the falls is a memorable experience.</p>
