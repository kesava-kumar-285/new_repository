                    <h3>About the Place</h3>

                  <p>Catherine Falls in Kotagiri near Ooty is made popular by its seclusion from the cacophony of the urban areas. The falls are nestled amidst the lush greens of the Nilgiris and are a pristine location to witness the beauty of nature. The water of the Kallar River, cut off by the Mettupalayam - Ooty road beyond the mountains, falls in a double cascade from over a height of 250 metres as it forms the Catherine Falls, making it the second highest waterfall of the Nilgiris. Located near Kotagiri, this tourist-favourite spot is often visited by people travelling the Ooty-Coonoor region for a place cut off from the crowd.

                    Catherine Falls is truly a place in the lap of nature for the travellers to soak in the ambience, for the explorers to discover all that nature has to offer, for the trekkers to take on the adventurous path and for the shutterbugs to capture some of the best sceneries. The emerald forests and tea gardens of the Nilgiris make the place look like a paradise of freshness and an abode for all the wilderness possible. An ideal spot for the tourists and 
                    the occasional wanderer soul as well - it is one of the best places to visit in the whole district of Nilgiri.</p>
